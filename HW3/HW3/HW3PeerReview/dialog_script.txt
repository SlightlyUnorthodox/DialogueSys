MYLA
What's wrong, luv?
RIM
I'm hungry.
MYLA
Then eat.  I don't mind.
RIM
But it's the last one.
MYLA
It's okay.
RIM
What about you?  Aren't you hungry?
MYLA
Not really.
RIM
I can't believe it's the last one.
MYLA
It had to happen sooner or later.
RIM
I was hoping for much later.
MYLA
Check under the table.  Maybe it fell down there.
RIM
Found it!  Time to eat... sure you don't want...
RIM (CONT.)
What is this!  The hunger games!
Rim sits on the sofa and looks at the empty coffee table.
RIM (CONT.)
Was I just imagining there was a can there?  I am that hungry.
Myla has a playful voice.
MYLA
Maybe.
RIM
Or maybe someone took it.
Rim leaps up suddenly and starts tickling Myla.
MYLA
Stop, stop, you'll make me have to pee.
RIM
Hand it over!
Myla
Okay, okay.
Myla holds up the can still laughing.  Rim takes the can.
RIM
You sure you don't want any.
MYLA
Nope.
RIM
Don't you dare.  You'll make a mess.
MYLA
The last can.
RIM
Afraid so.  
MYLA
Or maybe it is the first meal before the feast.
RIM
The feast?
They are still feeding each other.
MYLA
The feast that's waiting outside.
RIM
Maybe the radiation fried up all the critters and turned them to jerky?
Myla
Too bad you're a vegetarian.
RIM
And all the fruit is all dried up and ready for consumption.  
MYLA
And the water sparkles and bubbles like Perrier.
RIM
But you don't like Perrier.
MYLA
I'll drink anything we can find that isn't plain old bottled water.  I'm so sick of bottled water.  I miss bubbles.
RIM
I can make bubbles in your water.
MYLA
Ew, not those kind.
RIM
I wonder what it's really like outside.
MYLA
Not sure.  The monitor still shows radiation.
RIM
We're out of food.  Water is about out too.
MYLA
Time to start recycling.
RIM
You don't mean... ew.  I think I'd rather deal with the radiation.
MYLA
Thank you for sharing.
RIM
Of course.  I always do.
MYLA
You've always shared everything with me.
RIM
You're my favorite person.  I wanted to give you the best of everything... and the best of me.
MYLA
You always did... and you stayed with me to the end.
RIM
It's not the end... not yet.
MYLA
I remember when they said the bombs were coming... I was all alone.
RIM
I was terrified we wouldn't be together.
MYLA
Everyone was driving out of the city, trying to get far away from targets.  
RIM
I was driving the other way.  
MYLA
They wanted to arrest you... force you to go.
RIM
Nothing was going to keep me from you.
MYLA
I wasn't going in the shelter without you.
RIM
I remember I found you on the porch, sitting and looking up at the sky.
MYLA
I wondered what it would have looked like... all the missiles in the sky.  
RIM
I crashed the car in to that big tree in the yard.
MYLA
I was so glad you weren't hurt.  You scared me.
RIM
I was in a hurry.  No time for brakes.
MYLA
That would have been an ironic ending to your trip home.  Crashing and dying.
RIM
I didn't have a scratch on me.
MYLA
We were meant to be mole people together.
RIM
Burrowed together in our little nest.
MYLA
I like our little nest.
RIM
I think I've been happier here than I've ever been before.  
MYLA
Me too.
RIM
No interruptions.  No problems at work.  No outsiders getting their noses in our business.
MYLA
I never wanted to go outside again.
RIM
Except for the last can.
MYLA
We made it over a year.
RIM
I could go longer.
MYLA
Me too.
RIM
I wonder what the chair tastes like.
MYLA
That's my favorite chair!  You're not eating that.
MYLA (CONT.)
What are you doing?
RIM
Seeing if you dropped any food down here.
MYLA
You should check your sofa.  I'm a much cleaner eater than you.
RIM
What?
MYLA
You need a bib.  That's why I feed you so you don't make a mess.
RIM
Dang... you're right... no food here.
RIM (CONT.)
Jackpot.
MYLA
Told you.
RIM
Ha... veggie chips... I love these.
MYLA
Bon appetit.
RIM
Merci.

MYLA
How many are down there?
RIM
A year's supply I think.
MYLA
You wish.
RIM
If wishes were fishes...
MYLA
What does that mean?
RIM
No clue.
MYLA
So what do we do?
RIM
Go outside?
MYLA
But the radiation.
RIM
We might have to risk it.
MYLA
I wonder what it looks like outside.
RIM
Maybe all the bombs missed and it's all the same as before.  
MYLA
Then how do you explain the radiation?
RIM
You left the microwave on?
MYLA
Maybe.
MYLA (CONT.)
I wonder where we go?
RIM
Where was the last radio broadcast we heard?
MYLA
That was awhile ago.  I think I marked it on the map.
RIM
Some little station out in the boonies wasn't it?
MYLA
Who would have thought that the last bits of civilization would be in some little town in the middle of nowhere?
RIM
Nowhere became the only somewhere.
MYLA
I wonder how many people from the city went there?
RIM
I bet there wasn't enough food to go around.
MYLA
Scary.  What are the survivors going to do for food?
RIM
Maybe we don't want to go out there.
MYLA
I know I don't want to.
RIM
I wonder how our shoes would taste?  Didn't Charlie Chaplin do that in a movie?
MYLA
I don't know any Chaplin.  Heard of him of course.
RIM
I'm amazed how many movies you do know.  It's kept me pretty entertained.
MYLA
Want me to perform another movie for you?
RIM
I think Jurrasic Park is my favorite.  You do all the dinosaur actions too.
MYLA
I watched that one a lot as a kid.
RIM
I'm still amazed how well you memorized them all.
MYLA
One of my many special useless skills.
RIM
Sure came in handy now.
MYLA
I guess it did, didn't it?
RIM
You've kept me very entertained.
MYLA
I love what you wrote for me.
RIM
I love what you drew for me.
MYLA
It's probably been the most creative time in my life.
RIM
Me too.  I wonder if anyone will ever see anything we did.
MYLA

It doesn't matter.  I did it for you.
RIM
You're very sweet to me.  I can't imagine a better person to spend my life with.
MYLA
To be stuck with?
RIM
I never felt stuck... even before we became mole people... you were the best choice I ever made.
MYLA
You're very sweet to me.
RIM
You make me feel sweeter... I've never felt so happy.

MYLA
You've always taken good care of me.
RIM
I never wanted to fail you.
MYLA
You never did.
RIM
Until today...
Myla goes to him.
MYLA
What do you mean?
RIM
The food... it's gone.
MYLA
But we probably had more food than anyone else.  You prepared so much better than everyone else.  You always had everything covered... you always took care of everything.  
RIM
This is the first time I don't know what to do.  I never felt like this before.
MYLA
Like what?
RIM
Like I didn't know what to do... how to solve the problem.
MYLA
Maybe it's time you let someone else handle everything.
RIM
You have a plan?
MYLA
No, but I bet someone else does.

Myla points up.
RIM
Oh... I've always admired your faith.
MYLA

We've done well so far.
RIM
We have.
MYLA
I have a feeling something is going to happen.  Something good.
RIM
You know... I believe you.  I really believe you.
MYLA
I don't know what or how... but something good will happen.
RIM
I believe.
MYLA
Then close your eyes and get on your knees.
RIM
We're going to pray.
MYLA
Yes, pray.
RIM
I know I don't pray as often as a I should, but I really want to know, more than ever... rather than begging for something... I want to thank you for giving us this wonderful year together... I'm so thankful we got to be with each other... you've given me this wonderful gift and she is the most precious gift I've even been given... I thank you for her... I thank you with all my heart.
RIM (Cont.)
Amen.

RIM (CONT.)
You're an angel.
MYLA
I saved the best for last.

RIM
Do you hear that?
MYLA
That's the intercom.
RIM
It's picking up music from outside. Someone's playing music.

MYLA
Beautiful, beautiful music.
RIM
Should we go see?
MYLA
Maybe they're after our Diddly Doos?
RIM
Nothing is getting my Diddly Doos.  
RIM (CONT.)
Except you of course.
MYLA
It's coming closer.
RIM
I feel like a kid hearing an ice cream truck.
MYLA
Maybe it is an ice cream truck.
RIM
I like Diddly Doos better.
MYLA
Yummy... ice cream.
RIM
Should we go see?
MYLA
Okay.
RIM
Ready?
MYLA
Let me get my sweater.
RIM
Ah... that's such a cute sweater.
MYLA
Thank you.
RIM
Ready?
MYLA
I'm a little scared.
RIM
I'll be with you.
MYLA
Promise.
RIM
I promise. I'll never leave you.  
MYLA
You never do.
RIM
Let's go.
